## Technical Implementation

The system uses sophisticated pattern matching and keyword recognition to:
1. Parse billing descriptions for equipment and failure modes
2. Map equipment to appropriate systems and departments
3. Generate realistic causes, actions, and recommendations
4. Provide confidence scores for extraction accuracy
5. Create complete, structured NPT reports ready for review

This eliminates manual data entry and ensures consistent, comprehensive NPT reporting.
