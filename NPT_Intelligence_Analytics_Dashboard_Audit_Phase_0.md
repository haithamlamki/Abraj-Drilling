- `equipment` → `parentEquipment` mapping established
- `thePart` → `partEquipment` properly configured
- All validation schemas synchronized between client/server

### 2. NPT Type Enforcement Rules
**Status:** FULLY IMPLEMENTED ✅  
**Details:**
- **Department:** Editable only when NPT Type = "Abraj"
- **Contractual Process:** Enabled only when NPT Type = "Contractual"
- **Equipment/Failure Group:** Disabled for Contractual types
- Dynamic field cleanup on type changes
- Server-side validation mirrors frontend rules

### 3. Conditional Requirements Implementation
**Status:** ADVANCED IMPLEMENTATION ✅  
**N2 Number Requirements:**
- Drilling & Project: Required for hours 3.75-5.75
- Maintenance (M/E): Required for hours 2.0-5.75

**Investigation Report Requirements:**
- Required for hours ≥ 6.0
- Supports both file upload and AI-generated text

## Architecture Analysis

### Core Systems Overview

#### 1. NPT Rules Engine (`shared/nptRules.ts`)
```typescript
// Advanced field enablement logic
function enabledFields(nptType?: string) {
  const C = isContractual(nptType);
  const A = isAbraj(nptType);
  
  return {
    system: true,                  // Universal access
    department: A,                 // Abraj-specific
    contractualProcess: C,         // Contractual-specific
    // Equipment/Failure group (Abraj only):
    equipment: A, thePart: A, failureDesc: A,
    rootCause: A, corrective: A, futureAction: A,
    actionParty: A,
    n2Number: true,               // Always editable, conditionally required
  } as const;
}
```

#### 2. Database Schema (24 Specialized Tables)
**Core Tables:**
- `nptReports` - Primary NPT data with 25+ fields
- `workflowApprovals` - Approval tracking with edit history
- `monthlyReports` - Aggregated reporting with SLA tracking
- `reportDeliveries` - Delivery window management
- `alertRules` - Configurable alert system
- `delegations` - Out-of-office approval routing

**Enhanced Workflow Fields:**
- `currentStepOrder`, `currentNominalUserId`, `currentApproverUserId`
- `workflowStatus` enum: initiated → pending_ds → pending_pme → pending_ose → approved/rejected
- `workflowPath` differentiation: drilling vs e-maintenance departments

#### 3. Intelligent Processing Engine

**Billing Sheet Recognition:**
- Advanced pattern matching for rate types
- Equipment identification algorithms
- System classification with 29 Contractual categories
- Confidence scoring for extraction accuracy
- Automatic NBT classification based on repair/reduce repair/zero rate patterns

**Rate Type Extraction:**
- Dynamic extraction from table column headers
- Operating Rate filtering (excluded from NPT generation)
- Ticket number parsing for rig identification (DR20320250529202901 → Rig 203)
